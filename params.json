{"name":"Mikkel Dan-Rognlie","tagline":"Orginally from Copenhagen. Now living in Trondheim. Software developer at Bekk Consulting AS","body":"# [about.me/mikkelbd](http://about.me/mikkelbd)\r\n\r\nMikkel Dan-Rognlie works as senior consultant and competency group leader (fagleder) at Bekk Consulting AS. He has been developing software professionally since 2007 where he graduated as M.Sc. in Software Development from the IT-University of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nMikkel is an extrovert and passionate software developer with a primary focus on development on the JVM, but has also taken several detours on the CLR. Mikkel has deep experience with libraries and frameworks in the Java-world and design and implementation of cloud-based distributed systems as well as high-performance rich web applications.\r\n\r\nMikkel is originally from Copenhagen but lost his course and ended up in Trondheim. He found his passion in the Norwegian nature. When not developing software he is probably to be found on either skis (Nordic or alpine/randonnee), hiking or mountain biking. He most likely has more mountaineering equipment than the average Norwegian.","google":"UA-44825769-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
